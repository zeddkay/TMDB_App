# TMDB_App

This is a basic Android app I created as the final project for my DPS924 course at Seneca College.     
It utilizes the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. More details on the API can be found here:     
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
    
This app has 4 main functions:
- Search for a movie
- Search for a tv show
- Search for an actor
- View highest rated movies and tv shows


I plan on adding more features (such as filters, better looking pages) when I get some time. 
In the meantime, the above features work.

Here are some screenshots:

To run the app, simply download or clone the repository, open up Android Studio, and let the gradle build finish. 
You should then be able to run the project on an emulator/device.

If you have any questions or improvements, feel free to open up an issue. Thank you.
